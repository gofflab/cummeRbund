v1.1.1
	Bugfixes:
		- fixed issue in which there was no graceful error handling of missing CDS or TSS data in cuffdiff output.
		- Fixed issue in which distribution test data (promoters, splicing, relCDS) were not appropriately added to objects on creation.
		- Fixed bug that would sometimes cause csBoxplot() to throw an error when log-transforming fpkm data. Also added pseudocount argument.
		
	New Features:	
		- added getSig method to CuffSet class for rapid retrieval of significant features from all pairwise tests (as a list of IDs). 
		By default the level is 'genes' but any feature level can be queried.
	
	Notes:
		- Changed the default orientation of expressionBarplot() for CuffFeatureSet objects.
		- Changed output of csCluster to a list format that includes clustering information. As a result, I created the function csClusterPlot
		to replace the default drawing behavior of csCluster previously.  This allows for stable cluster analysis.
