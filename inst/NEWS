v1.1.3
	

v1.1.1
	Bugfixes:
		- fixed issue in which there was no graceful error handling of missing CDS or TSS data in cuffdiff output.
		- Fixed issue in which distribution test data (promoters, splicing, relCDS) were not appropriately added to objects on creation.
		- Fixed bug that would sometimes cause csBoxplot() to throw an error when log-transforming fpkm data. Also added pseudocount argument.
		- Fixed bug that would cause diffData() to return a filtered subset of results by default.
		- Adjusted indexing of tables to improve performance on large datasets.
		- Fixed bug that caused diffData method to not be registered with CuffFeature and CuffGene objects.
		
	New Features:	
		- added getSig method to CuffSet class for rapid retrieval of significant features from all pairwise tests (as a list of IDs). 
		By default the level is 'genes' but any feature level can be queried.
		- csCluster now uses Jensen-Shannon distance by default (as opposed to Euclidean)
		- Added 'xlimits' argument to csVolcano to constrain plot dimensions.
		- Enforced requirement in csVolcano for x and y arguments (as sample names).
	
	Notes:
		- Changed dependency 'reshape' to 'reshape2'
		- Changed the default orientation of expressionBarplot() for CuffFeatureSet objects.
		- Changed output of csCluster to a list format that includes clustering information. As a result, I created the function csClusterPlot
		to replace the previous default drawing behavior of csCluster.  This allows for stable cluster analysis.
		- For consistency, the 'testId' slot for CuffDist objects was renamed to 'idField'.  This brings the CuffDist class in line with the CuffData class.
		- CuffGene and CuffGeneSet now include slots for promoter, splicing, and relCDS distribution test results.
v1.0.0
	- Official public release. No changes from v0.99.5

v0.99.5
	- Significant speed improvements to readCufflinks() for large cuffdiff datasets.
		- Tables written first then indexed.
	- Added slot accessor methods to avoid using slots directly.
	
v0.99.4
	- Second beta release and submission to Bioconductor

v0.1.3 Release 2011-08-18:
	- First Beta release of cummeRbund and submission to Bioconductor for review and hosting.
