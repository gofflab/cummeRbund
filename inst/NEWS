v1.1.3 
	New Features:
		- Added ability in getSig to limit retrieval of significant genes to two provided conditions (arguments x & y). (reduces time for function call if you have a specific comparison in mind a priori)
	
	Bugfixes:
		- Fixed bug in getGenes that may have resulted in long query lag for retrieving promoter diffData.
		- CuffData fpkm argument 'features' now returns appropriate data.frame (includes previously un-reported data fields).
		- Replaced all instances of 'ln_fold_change' with the actual 'log2_fold_change'.  Values were previously log2 fold change but database headers were not updated to reflect this.
	
	Notes:
		- Updated vignette
		- A 'fullnames' logical argument was added to fpkmMatrix. If True, rownames for fpkmMatrix will be a concatenation of gene_short_name and tracking_id.
		This has the added benefit of making row labels in csHeatmap easier to read, as well as preserving uniqueness. 
	
v1.1.1
	Bugfixes:
		- fixed issue in which there was no graceful error handling of missing CDS or TSS data in cuffdiff output.
		- Fixed issue in which distribution test data (promoters, splicing, relCDS) were not appropriately added to objects on creation.
		- Fixed bug that would sometimes cause csBoxplot() to throw an error when log-transforming fpkm data. Also added pseudocount argument.
		- Fixed bug that would cause diffData() to return a filtered subset of results by default.
		- Adjusted indexing of tables to improve performance on large datasets.
		- Fixed bug that caused diffData method to not be registered with CuffFeature and CuffGene objects.
		- Fixed bug that sometimes caused over-plotting of axis labels in csBarplots.  
		
	New Features:	
		- added getSig method to CuffSet class for rapid retrieval of significant features from all pairwise tests (as a list of IDs). 
		By default the level is 'genes' but any feature level can be queried.
		- csCluster now uses Jensen-Shannon distance by default (as opposed to Euclidean)
		- Added 'xlimits' argument to csVolcano to constrain plot dimensions.
		- Enforced requirement in csVolcano for x and y arguments (as sample names).
	
	Notes:
		- Changed dependency 'reshape' to 'reshape2'
		- Changed the default orientation of expressionBarplot() for CuffFeatureSet objects.
		- Changed output of csCluster to a list format that includes clustering information. As a result, I created the function csClusterPlot
		to replace the previous default drawing behavior of csCluster.  This allows for stable cluster analysis.
		- For consistency, the 'testId' slot for CuffDist objects was renamed to 'idField'.  This brings the CuffDist class in line with the CuffData class.
		- CuffGene and CuffGeneSet now include slots for promoter, splicing, and relCDS distribution test results.
